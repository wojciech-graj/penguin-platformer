# PS1-shaders-for-godot
A collection of PS1 shaders for godot.

This shaders are modified version of this shader: https://github.com/marmitoTH/godot-psx-shaders

This were modified by me to solve specific problems in my projects. Specifically lighting issues, and create moving water. 

Have fun using this :)
